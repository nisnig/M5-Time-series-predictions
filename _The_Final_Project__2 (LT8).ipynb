        "Our process of improving on the WRMSSE in part one explores three tracts—the first is simply other ETS configurations, the second is some simple RNNs and LSTMs, and finally an ensemble solution.  The stages in this process are as follows:<br>\n",
        "1. As a sort of pre-work, the first step for this series of experiments is to make the interpolation process more sophisticated.  Whereas previously we simply used Pandas' time interpolation, for the experiments we interpolated the values using Light GBM.  For values not solved by the interpolation, we defaulted to backfilling NaN values, as before.<br><br>\n",
        "2. For the simplest round of experiments, we started with going through the permutations of the ETS model configurations (different combinations of `add` or `mul` for error, trend, and season).  <b>In terms of simply getting a better WRMSSE, we have achieved it with the (M,M,M) ETS model.</b><br><br>\n",
        "3. Before proceeding into the neural network modeling itself, we took the time to determine the optimum lookback window for our data. For this we again used Light GBM to test through five possible values in the range of one week to one month.  Also, rather than using a single lookback window for all, we used the hypertuned window for each index in our data.<br><br>\n",
        "4. The next part had three different sections: the first to test different RNN architectures, the second to repeat the same for LSTM architectures, and finally to also experiment with a seq2seq model. Note that for all the neural network models, forecasts were made using a single-shot approach. <b>From the results of this stage, we also added the layer of decomposing each time-series into trend, 7-day seasonality, and residuals for our final phase.</b><br><br>\n",
        "5. For the final experiment, we combined most of our better performing models as an ensemble forecaster, with inclusion based on the calculated (W)RMSSE."

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
